TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.Foldout:						Tree Properties | A group of global tree properties. Add parts to the tree in the Hierarchy view above.

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.Distribution:					Distribution |
TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.GroupSeed:						Tree Seed | The global seed that affects the entire tree. Use it to randomize your tree, while keeping the general structure of it.

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.GroundOffset:					Ground Offset | Adjusts the offset of trunk nodes on Y axis.

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.Geometry:						Geometry |

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.AODensity:						AO Density | Adjusts the density of ambient occlusion.
TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.LODQuality:					LOD Quality | Defines the level-of-detail for the entire tree. A low value will make the tree less complex, a high value will make the tree more complex. Check the statistics in the hierarchy view to see the current complexity of the mesh.

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.AlphaCutoff:					Alpha Cutoff | Alpha values from the base texture smaller than the alpha cutoff are clipped creating a cutout.
TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.ShadowStrength:				Shadow Strength | Makes the shadows on the leaves less harsh. Since it scales all the shadowing that the leaves receive, it should be used with care for trees that are e.g. in a shadow of a mountain.
TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.ShadowOffsetScale:				Shadow Offset | Scales the values from the Shadow Offset texture set in the source material. It is used to offset the position of the leaves when collecting the shadows, so that the leaves appear as if they were not placed on one quad.

Start out with a black texture and add different shades of gray per leaf.

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.ShadowTextureQuality:			Shadow Caster Res. | Defines the resolution of the texture atlas containing alpha values from source diffuse textures. The atlas is used when the leaves are rendered as shadow casters. Using lower resolution might increase performance.
TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.ShadowTextureQualityOption.Full:	Full Res |

TreeEditor.TreeGroupRoot.ShadowTextureQualityOption.Quarter:	Quarter Res |
